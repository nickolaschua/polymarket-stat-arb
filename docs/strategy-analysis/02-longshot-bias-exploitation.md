# Strategy 2: Longshot Bias Exploitation

## Feasibility Score: 6/10

---

## Concept

Retail traders systematically overvalue low-probability outcomes (the "lottery ticket effect"). Markets priced at 5-15% are actually worth 3-10%, meaning you can profit by systematically selling YES (buying NO) on these overpriced longshots.

```
If market_price > true_probability * 1.2:  # Overpriced by >20%
    BUY NO (fade the longshot)
    Size: small, across many positions for diversification
```

This is a variance-harvesting strategy. You win 80-90% of the time (small wins), but lose big when the "impossible" happens.

## What You'd Need to Implement This

### Data Requirements
- **Historical resolution data**: Track how often markets at each price level actually resolve YES
  - e.g., Markets trading at $0.10 → what % actually resolved YES?
  - Need 500+ resolved low-probability markets for statistical significance
- **Market metadata**: Category, time to resolution, volume, number of traders
- **Calibration curves**: Build empirical calibration mapping market_price → true_probability for each category

### Resources & Compute
| Resource | Requirement | Cost Estimate |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Historical data | Scrape resolved markets via Gamma API | Free |
| Compute | Minimal — this is a statistical strategy, not ML-heavy | $20-30/month |
| Capital diversification | Need 20-50+ positions simultaneously | Requires $500-2,000 spread thin |
| Non-US server | Required for Polymarket access | $30-80/month |

### Technical Skills Required
- Statistical analysis (calibration curves, hypothesis testing)
- Basic ML for improved probability estimation (optional but helpful)
- Portfolio construction (diversification across uncorrelated markets)
- Position management (monitoring, early exits)

## What Would Be Your Edge?

### The Academic Evidence Is Strong

The longshot-favorite bias is one of the most well-documented anomalies in gambling markets:
- **50+ years of evidence** across horse racing, sports betting, and prediction markets
- Empirical study (12,084 matches): Favorites returned -3.64%, underdogs -26.08%
- The bias persists because it's behavioral (lottery preferences), not informational

### Where Your ML Skills Add Value

1. **Calibration modeling**: Instead of naively fading all longshots, build a calibration model:
   - Input: market price, category, time to resolution, volume, volatility
   - Output: estimated true probability
   - This lets you identify WHICH longshots are most overpriced

2. **Correlation detection**: The biggest risk is correlated longshot hits (e.g., political upset affects multiple markets). NLP can group markets by topic to manage correlation risk.

3. **Dynamic hedging**: Use your model to detect when a longshot is becoming less overpriced (information arriving) and exit early.

### Estimated Edge: 2-5% per position (on average across portfolio)

## Is the Alpha Already Arbitraged Away?

### Partially — but the bias persists

1. **The bias is behavioral, not informational**: It exists because humans have a cognitive preference for lottery-like payoffs. This doesn't go away with more competition.

2. **Institutional faders exist**: Some sophisticated traders already do this systematically. The IMDEA study found top wallets extracting millions, some likely through bias exploitation.

3. **But the market is still massively inefficient**: The same IMDEA study found 41% of conditions mispriced by an average of 40%. This includes longshot mispricing.

4. **New markets constantly appear**: Polymarket launches new markets daily. Each new market starts with price discovery, creating fresh opportunities.

### The alpha compression risk is moderate:
- More bots entering the space → longshot prices may become more accurate
- But retail flow keeps the bias alive (new uninformed bettors constantly enter)
- The bias has persisted for 50+ years in other markets despite being well-documented

## Why Don't More People Do This?

1. **Psychological difficulty**: You win 85% of trades (small wins) but the 15% losses are LARGE. Most humans can't emotionally handle this payoff profile, even when it's +EV. It feels like "picking up pennies in front of a steamroller."

2. **Fat tail risk is real**: When the "impossible" happens (Trump 2016, Leicester City 2016, COVID), you can lose multiple positions simultaneously. Correlated black swans are the killer.

3. **Capital lock-up**: Each NO position ties up $0.85-0.95 per contract. With 20-50 positions, your capital is locked for weeks-months. At $500-2K starting capital, this severely limits position count.

4. **Liquidity in tail markets**: Markets priced at $0.05-0.15 often have low liquidity. You can't exit quickly if your thesis changes.

5. **Small absolute returns**: With $1K capital and 2-5% monthly return, you're making $20-50/month. The risk-adjusted return may not justify the effort at small scale.

## Possible Exposure (Risk)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Correlated black swan** | CRITICAL | Diversify across uncorrelated categories (politics, crypto, sports, weather). Never hold >5% in one market. Use NLP to detect thematic clusters. |
| **Single large loss** | HIGH | Max 2-5% per position. Accept that 1-2 losses per 10 trades is normal. |
| **Capital lock-up** | MEDIUM | Focus on markets resolving within 1-2 months. Avoid long-dated markets unless spread is exceptional. |
| **Liquidity risk** | MEDIUM | Only enter markets with sufficient NO-side depth (>$1K visible in orderbook). |
| **Platform oracle risk** | LOW-MEDIUM | The Zelenskyy suit case (June 2025) showed oracle governance can resolve markets unexpectedly. Only trade markets with clear, objective criteria. |
| **Regime change** | LOW | If prediction markets become more efficient overall, longshot bias may diminish. Monitor your calibration curves over time. |

### Worst-Case Scenario
With $1,000 capital split across 20 positions ($50 each):
- Normal month: Win 17, lose 3 → +$42 profit (after losses)
- Bad month: Correlated upset hits 5 positions → -$250 loss (25% drawdown)
- Black swan month: 8+ correlated losses → -$400 loss (40% drawdown)

## Additional Considerations

### Your Capital Constraint is a Problem

At $500-2K, this strategy is mechanically difficult:
- Need 20-50 positions for proper diversification
- At $50/position, you need $1,000-2,500 minimum
- Each position earns only $2-5 (small win on $50 position)
- A single black swan wipes out weeks of gains

**This strategy works better at $5K+ capital** where you can properly diversify.

### ML Enhancement: Calibrated Longshot Scorer

Your ML skills can improve this strategy significantly by building a calibrated scorer:

```
Input features:
- Market price (implied probability)
- Category (politics, crypto, sports, other)
- Time to resolution
- Trading volume / number of traders
- Price history (momentum)
- Semantic similarity to resolved markets

Output:
- Calibrated probability estimate
- Confidence interval
- Correlation cluster assignment
```

This transforms a simple statistical strategy into a model-driven one, but the model is simpler than Strategy 1 — it's a calibration function, not a full probability model.

### Comparison to Traditional Options Selling

This strategy is analogous to selling out-of-the-money options:
- You collect premium (small, frequent wins)
- You get crushed on tail events (large, infrequent losses)
- The key is sizing: never bet enough that a tail event kills you
- Unlike options, prediction markets don't have implied volatility → you can't hedge with vega

## Verdict

**Worth investing time: MODERATE**

The academic evidence is strong and the bias is real, but your capital constraint ($500-2K) makes proper diversification difficult. At small scale, a single black swan can wipe out months of gains. This strategy is better suited as a **secondary/complementary strategy** once you've built capital from Strategy 1 (probability arbitrage) or Strategy 5 (combinatorial arbitrage).

If you do pursue it, your ML skills add value primarily through calibration modeling and correlation detection — but the core strategy is more statistical than ML-heavy, so it doesn't fully leverage your strongest skills.

**Time to first results**: 2-3 weeks (data collection + calibration curves + paper trading)
**Capital efficiency**: Low (capital locked in many small positions)
**Scalability**: Good at $5K+ capital, poor below that
