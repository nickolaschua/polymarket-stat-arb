<context>
Phase 3 is 2/4 plans complete. The next plan (03-03) is the WebSocket trade listener —
this is the first plan that requires the external WebSocket research (03-RESEARCH.md).
The research was completed in a prior session and is available at
.planning/phases/03-websocket-trades/03-RESEARCH.md.

03-03 will be the most complex plan in this phase — real-time WebSocket connection to
wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com for trade events.

Execute 03-03-PLAN.md (WebSocket Trade Listener Core):
  /gsd:execute-plan .planning/phases/03-websocket-trades/03-03-PLAN.md

Recommend /clear first for a fresh context window — 03-03 is substantial.
